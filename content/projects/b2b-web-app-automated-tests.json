          "Test Strategy & Planning: Collaborated with development and QA teams to identify critical user flows, high-priority functionalities, and key scenarios for test automation within the ASP.NET MVC B2B web application.",
          "Framework Selection & Setup: Researched and selected Playwright as the automated testing framework due to its strong support for modern web applications, multiple browser capabilities, and ease of integration with .NET.",
          "Test Suite Development: Developed a comprehensive suite of automated tests using Playwright (likely with C# given the ASP.NET MVC backend). These tests simulated real user interactions across various critical workflows, such as login, navigation, data entry, and form submissions.",
          "Data Management for Tests: Implemented strategies for managing test data, including setup and teardown procedures, to ensure tests were repeatable and independent.",
          "CI/CD Integration: Integrated the automated test suite into the existing CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps, Jenkins). This ensured that tests automatically ran on every code commit or build, providing immediate feedback on code quality and regressions.",
          "Reporting & Analytics: Configured test reporting to provide clear, actionable results, making it easy to identify failed tests and underlying issues.",
          "Maintenance & Scalability: Designed the test suite with maintainability and scalability in mind, using modular and reusable components to facilitate future test creation and updates.",
          "Collaboration & Training: Worked closely with development and QA teams to ensure alignment on testing goals and provided training on interpreting test results and contributing to the test suite."
