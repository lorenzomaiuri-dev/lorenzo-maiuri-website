        "title": "Implemented Solution",
        "content": "I researched and developed a pure Python-based solution that acts as a generic data reporter. The script incorporates a flexible database wrapper to connect to various SQL databases, utilizes dedicated libraries for generating different output formats, and integrates with FTP/SFTP and email protocols for diverse distribution needs. Its key strength lies in its INI-file driven configuration, making it incredibly adaptable and user-friendly for scheduling and customization."

          "Core Script Development (Python): Developed the central Python script to manage the entire reporting workflow, from data extraction to formatting and distribution.",
          "Generic Database Wrapper: Implemented a generic database connection and query execution wrapper in Python, allowing the script to connect to various SQL databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle) using their respective Python drivers.",
          "Report Format Generation: Integrated Python libraries (`openpyxl` for Excel, `json` for JSON, `csv` for CSV) to enable the generation of reports in the specified output formats based on query results.",
          "Distribution Channel Integration: Incorporated Python libraries for email automation (`smtplib`), FTP (`ftplib`), and SFTP (`paramiko`) to support multiple delivery methods.",
          "INI File Configuration Module: Designed and implemented a robust INI file parsing module (using `configparser`) to allow users to define database connections, SQL queries, output formats, distribution channels, and scheduling parameters dynamically without modifying the code.",
          "Error Handling & Logging: Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure robustness and facilitate troubleshooting for various reporting tasks.",
          "Scheduling Integration (Conceptual/External): Designed the script to be easily integrated with external scheduling tools (cron jobs on Linux, Task Scheduler on Windows) by allowing all necessary parameters to be passed via the INI file.",
          "Testing & Validation: Conducted extensive testing to ensure the script's flexibility across different database types, report formats, and distribution channels, validating its reliability and configurability."
