          "Requirement Gathering & Analysis: Collaborated with stakeholders to understand existing traceability workflows, compliance requirements, and pain points related to manual tracking and rejected submissions.",
          "System Architecture Design: Designed the overall architecture, defining the interaction between the React frontend, Node.js/Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and external XML-based APIs for Ministry of Health transmissions.",
          "Database Design & Implementation: Developed a PostgreSQL database schema to store transmission history, rejected records, and associated metadata, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.",
          "Backend Development (Node.js/Express.js): Built a RESTful API to manage data, process incoming and outgoing traceability information, handle XML data parsing for Ministry submissions, and integrate with external systems.",
          "Frontend Development (React): Developed an intuitive and responsive graphical user interface (GUI) allowing users to easily view transmission history, filter rejected records, and initiate recovery operations.",
          "Error Handling & Recovery Logic: Implemented sophisticated logic within the application to automatically track rejected submissions, provide clear reasons for rejection, and guide users through streamlined recovery processes.",
          "XML Data Processing: Developed modules for generating and parsing XML files compliant with the Italian Ministry of Health's specifications for data exchange.",
          "Docker Containerization: Containerized the entire application stack (frontend, backend, database) using Docker, ensuring consistent development and production environments and simplifying deployment.",
          "Testing & Validation: Conducted thorough testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the application's functionality, accuracy, and compliance."
