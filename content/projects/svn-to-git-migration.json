          "Assessment and Planning: Conducted a thorough assessment of existing SVN repositories, including branching strategies, commit history, and integration points. Developed a detailed migration plan, outlining phases, tools, and rollback strategies.",
          "Tool Selection & Setup: Researched and selected appropriate migration tools (`git-svn`) to facilitate the transfer of SVN history, branches, and tags to Git while preserving commit metadata.",
          "Pilot Migration & Testing: Performed pilot migrations for smaller repositories to identify potential issues, refine the migration process, and validate data integrity and history preservation in Git.",
          "Repository Conversion: Executed the conversion of SVN repositories to Git, carefully preserving commit history, author mapping, and branch/tag structures.",
          "Git Repository Configuration: Configured the new Git repositories to match the team's desired branching models, access permissions, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.",
          "Post-Migration Verification: Conducted extensive verification to ensure all data was accurately transferred and the new Git repositories were fully functional and ready for use.",
          "Team Training & Support: Provided comprehensive training sessions and documentation to development teams on Git workflows, best practices, and the specifics of the new repository structure. Offered immediate support for any post-migration queries or issues.",
          "Decommissioning SVN: Collaborated with relevant teams to safely decommission the old SVN repositories once the migration was complete and stable."
